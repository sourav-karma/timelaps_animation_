# timelaps_animation_

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing historical Landsat imagery of the Brahmaputra river entry point using Google Earth Engine (GEE). 
The script retrieves the best cloud-free images from 1990 to 2011, visualizes time-series changes, and generates GIF/MP4 animations of river landscape dynamics.
